PROCESS
Feedback -> Categorization -> Classification -> Sentimental Analysis -> Overview

STEP:
1. From that feedback, apply categorization techniques.
2. Specifically, count how much feedback there is about the product and how many services there are.
3. Next from each of those categories, classify how many positive reviews there are, how many negative reviews there are using classification as well as sentimental problems.
4. From the above reviews, please provide an overview of the product.

SOLUTION:
STEP:
+ Categorization: Use the K-Means algorithm to categorize the feedback.
+ Classification: Use the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify the feedback.
+ Sentimental Analysis: Use the TextBlob library to analyze the feedback.
+ Overview: Summarize the feedback using the TextRank algorithm.
TECHNIC:
* Build a model to classify the feedback.
* Use the NLP (Natural Language Processing) technique to analyze the feedback.
* Use the TextBlob library to analyze the feedback.
* Use the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library to analyze the feedback.
